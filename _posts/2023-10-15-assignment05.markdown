**PROTOTYPE 01**
***Introduction***
After receiving Arduino components, a fan, and a battery, I began working on designing and prototyping a potential fan. I decided to deviate from my initial design in search of something more distinctive and original.

At this point, I've started exploring alternative designs and shapes for the new fan, with the goal of achieving a sleek, cylindrical form. 

The fan can be positioned either in the middle or at the bottom of the cylinder-shaped structure. Placing it in the middle might pose a challenge in terms of generating sufficient airflow through the fan.

Before deciding where to put the fan, I wanted to figure out how the fan's parts could be separated. This way, I could make changes more easily and save time instead of having to print the entire body if I wasn't happy with the design. It seemed like a practical and time-saving approach.

I started designing the body to fit the PC fan, which had a size of 70x70 millimeters.

I added a hole in the corner of the design for the fan cables to pass through. However, when I printed and assembled the part, I soon realized that the hole was too small for the wires to fit through. I had to make adjustments and come up with a solution to thread the wires. The hole was also on the wrong side because the actual fan didn't match the one I had uploaded online.
