Welcome to my first Jekyll website and blog-ish portfolio post!

I've created various websites during my bachelor's degree and free time, and I must say that Jekyll is, by far, the easiest framework to learn. Compared to using frameworks like Python Django, Flask, and even popular ones like ReactJS, Jekyll stands out as an ideal choice for beginners and individuals who don't require complex features beyond a static webpage. It's a real timesaver!

Learning this framework has been easy, but frustrating at times due to mistakes I've made throughout the learning process. The first mistake I made was modifying the HTML files, which was a big no-no. Whenever I rendered the Markdown files, everything reset. That's when I realised that documentation and watching tutorial videos was essential to master this framework.

While I'm not yet an expert in Jekyll, I've picked up the basics and foundational understanding. Frankly, I'd still lean towards using other frameworks due to their broader range of features and functionalities. This framework can be a real time-saver when you need to modify basic features. However, if you're dealing with something more complex, it can quickly turn into a coding nightmare.
