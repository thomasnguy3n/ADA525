**CAD Final Project**

After a brief discussion with my professor, Frikk Fossdal, I began to conceptualize the pocket fan project. We aimed to create a stylish and innovative pocket fan with some tech-savvy features.

New ideas, new list for the project!

- ***Battery***: Typical AA batteries. No need for a separate circuit board.
- ***Fan Blades*** and Motor: Provided by Professor Frikk Fossdal (PC fan).
- ***Switch***: Required for turning the fan on and off.
- ***Arduino***: The central control unit for the pocket fan.
- ***Motion/Orientation Controller***: A random chip to control device movement.
- ***Wires & Connectors***: Necessary for connecting the motor, battery, and switch.
- ***Fan Body***: A protective 3D-printed casing to enclose and secure components for safety.
- ***Minor Parts***: Screws and glue may be needed for assembly.

A homemade pocket fan that goes beyond the standardized pocket fans you find on eBay or AliExpress. A pocket fan that will 100% cool you down. That's what we envisioned.

As you can see from the image, it has a relatively large fan for a PC fan, but who really cares? It's all about creating the best product. I just imported a standardized PC-fan online, but I will probably adjust the "head" if the original PC fan is different.

It also features an on/off button, but it won't function properly unless we incorporate a gesture control system. We want the fan to start spinning within a couple of seconds whenever we make a hand movement with the device. To achieve this, we need components such as an Arduino and a "motion/orientation controller" that will communicate with the Arduino to detect these movements. We'll also have to write some machine learning code to make it work.

On the bottom of the fan, we plan to implement a "lunch box" top principle, allowing us to open the shell to install the necessary cables and replace the batteries. This idea was inspired by the Fusion360 - Lunch Box presentation we recently attended.

I haven't fully considered the breakdown of the parts yet, but once I receive the PC fan from Professor Frikk, I can begin conceptualizing the frame and assess whether it needs to be separate from the main body. I'll likely need to incorporate bearings throughout the 3D print.

When I say 'we', I'm referring to Professor Frikk and myself.
