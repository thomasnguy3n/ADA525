***Introduction***

When I initially began this project, I started by reading the documentation for the various packages I was planning to use. This included ExpressJS and ChartJS. Although I had previous experience with other frameworks like ReactJS and Django, I had no prior experience with NodeJS. I saw this as a fresh opportunity to learn and become familiar with a new framework.

At first, I wanted to use real-time data that was constantly updated, but I realized that it was more complex than the initial task required. I quickly understood that I would have to work with APIs and other components, which were too complicated for the assignment. Therefore, I decided to use a random number generator that would produce a new number every 5 seconds.

***Project Steps***

I started building this web server in a designated folder, and initialized nodeJS project and downloaded the neccessary packages for the project.

{% raw %}```Terminal
npm init -y
```{% endraw %}

{% raw %}```Terminal
npm install express chart.js
```{% endraw %}

After the necessary packages were downloaded, the required coding files had to be created with the correct project structure.

A html file had to be created - *index.html*

{% raw %}```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Real-time Data Visualization</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

    <canvas id="data-chart"></canvas>
    <script src="/client.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```{% endraw %}

The same with a javascript file - *client.js*

{% raw %}```Javascript
const dataURL = '/data';
const ctx = document.getElementById('data-chart').getContext('2d');
const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        labels: [],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Assignment 07: Web Server 1 - Real-time Data',
            data: [],
            borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)',
            borderWidth: 1,
        }]
    },
    options: {
        responsive: true,
        maintainAspectRatio: false,
        scales: {
            y: {
                min: 0,     // Set the minimum value of the y-axis
                max: 100,   // Set the maximum value of the y-axis
                ticks: {
                    stepSize: 10, // Set the step size between ticks
                },
            },
            x: [{
                type: 'linear',
                position: 'bottom'
            }]
        }
    }
});

function fetchDataAndVisualize() {
    fetch(dataURL)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            chart.data.labels.push(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
            chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.value);

            if (chart.data.labels.length > 10) {
                chart.data.labels.shift();
                chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();
            }

            chart.update();
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        });
}

fetchDataAndVisualize();
setInterval(fetchDataAndVisualize, 5000);
```{% endraw %}

And finally, a file to run the server - *server.js*

{% raw %}```Javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    const randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
    res.json({ value: randomValue });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```{% endraw %}
