***Introduction***

When I initially began this project, I started by reading the documentation for the various packages I was planning to use. This included ExpressJS and ChartJS. Although I had previous experience with other frameworks like ReactJS and Django, I had no prior experience with NodeJS. I saw this as a fresh opportunity to learn and become familiar with a new framework.

At first, I wanted to use real-time data that was constantly updated, but I realized that it was more complex than the initial task required. I quickly understood that I would have to work with APIs and other components, which were too complicated for the assignment. Therefore, I decided to use a random number generator that would produce a new number every different seconds.

***Project Steps***

I started building this web server in a designated folder, and initialized nodeJS project and downloaded the neccessary packages for the project.

{% raw %}```Terminal
npm init -y
```{% endraw %}

{% raw %}```Terminal
npm install express chart.js
```{% endraw %}

After the necessary packages were downloaded, the required coding files had to be created with the correct project structure.

A html file had to be created - *index.html*

{% raw %}```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Real-time Data Visualization</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

    <canvas id="data-chart"></canvas>
    <script src="/client.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```{% endraw %}

The same with a javascript file - *client.js*

{% raw %}```Javascript
const dataURL = '/data';
const ctx = document.getElementById('data-chart').getContext('2d');
const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        labels: [],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Assignment 07: Web Server 1 - Real-time Data',
            data: [],
            borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)',
            borderWidth: 1,
        }]
    },
    options: {
        responsive: true,
        maintainAspectRatio: false,
        scales: {
            y: {
                min: 0,     // Set the minimum value of the y-axis
                max: 100,   // Set the maximum value of the y-axis
                ticks: {
                    stepSize: 10, // Set the step size between ticks
                },
            },
            x: [{
                type: 'linear',
                position: 'bottom'
            }]
        }
    }
});

function fetchDataAndVisualize() {
    fetch(dataURL)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            chart.data.labels.push(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
            chart.data.datasets[0].data.push(data.value);

            if (chart.data.labels.length > 10) {
                chart.data.labels.shift();
                chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift();
            }

            chart.update();
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        });
}

fetchDataAndVisualize();
setInterval(fetchDataAndVisualize, 5000);
```{% endraw %}

And finally, a file to run the server - *server.js*

{% raw %}```Javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    const randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
    res.json({ value: randomValue });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```{% endraw %}

***Results***

The end result is a web server with a chart that updates every 5 seconds. The Y-axis consist of values from the Math.random() function while the X-axis consist of the timestamp. I had trouble at the beginning of my code when I didn't include the time stamp on the X-axis, since the Y-value always changed on x = 0. Therefore the line didn't show up as expected.  

![web-server](https://github.com/thomasnguy3n/ADA525/assets/142970936/01d7bdf6-0588-4ee6-9d10-21c37f73c64b){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 3000px; height: 150px;"}

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50px;">
  <p>Screenshot of the updating chart</p>
</div>

The thought process behind the design is quite simple. I wanted a plain and minimalistic design with no drastic colors. Therefore I went with the colors blue and grey. I could have extended the Y-axis into something more or less than a 100, but since I had the Math.function() in between 0 and 100, I needed the Y-axis to be at least 100.

***Next***

I wanted to implement new ChartJS functions that allow for chart animations. After reading the [documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/animations.html), I incorporated the new features into the code.

{% raw %}```Javascript
// client.js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const ctx = document.getElementById('data-chart').getContext('2d');
    const dataPoints = [];

    const config = {
        type: 'line',
        data: {
            labels: [],
            datasets: [{
                label: 'Assignment 07: Web Server 1 - Real-time Data',
                data: dataPoints,
                borderColor: 'blue',
                borderWidth: 2,
                fill: false,
            }],
        },
        options: {
            animation: {
                duration: 2000,
                easing: 'linear',
            },
            scales: {
                y: {
                    min: 0,
                    max: 100,
                },
            },
        },
    };

    const chart = new Chart(ctx, config);

    function fetchLiveData() {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
    }

    setInterval(() => {
        const newDataPoint = fetchLiveData();
        dataPoints.push(newDataPoint);

        // Update the chart
        chart.data.labels.push(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
        chart.data.datasets[0].data = dataPoints;
        chart.update();
    }, 2000);
});
```{% endraw %}

{% raw %}```HTML

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

<body>
    <canvas id="data-chart" width="800" height="300"></canvas>

    <script src="client.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```{% endraw %}

I also changed the size of the chart into a readable one, whereas earlier it was too small because I didn't set the width and height of the chart.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50px;">
  <p>Screenshot of the updating chart - V2</p>
</div>

Now I wanted to see how this would look like in a bar-chart. I just did a minor adjustment in the *client.js*-file where I wrote '*bar*' instead of '*line*'.

![web-server-v3](https://github.com/thomasnguy3n/ADA525/assets/142970936/083edccf-880f-4fef-9974-44d3400f4a2c){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 700px; height: 500px;"}

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50px;">
  <p>Screenshot of the updating bar-chart - V3</p>
</div>

***After-thoughts***

I plan to integrate this technology into my final project by creating a web server that displays a chart illustrating the fan's movements. This not only allows me to analyze data from the Arduino but also enhances the project aesthetically.

While P5JS appears to be a cool library with awesome features, due to time constraints, I had to prioritize the completion of the final project over exploring P5JS.
