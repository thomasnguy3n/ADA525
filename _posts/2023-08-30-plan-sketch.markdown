**THE PROJECT IDEA**

From the start of the ADA525 course, I had various ideas brewing in my mind â€“ a party lamp, an alarm clock, even smart curtains. The possibilities seemed endless. The only challenge was that I wasn't fully aware of the software and tools' limitations we were going to work with.

One day, while on a hot and crowded Bybane, I had a practical thought. I needed something that could help me cope with the heat and stale air. Something small and portable, easy to carry and put away. And that's when the idea of creating a simple, pocket-sized fan struck me.

**WHAT NOW?**

I had many thoughts. What should it look like? What pieces and tools are needed? How can I design something I don't know anything about? I'm not an engineer, I'm a computer scientist.

I needed to start small. I began listing up essential parts that I thought of for this pocket-sized fan. 
- ***Battery:*** A rechargeable battery that can be charged using a cable.
- ***Fan Blades:*** Blades to generate airflow. Probably need to 3D-print these.
- ***Motor:*** A small motor that can generate spin for the fan blades.
- ***Switch:*** A switch to turn the fan on and off.
- ***Wires & connectors:*** Wires to connect the motor, battery, and switch.
- ***Charging port:*** Charging port that is assosciated to the rechargeable battery. Probably USB-C.
- ***Fan-body:*** A protective body to secure the components and ensure safety. Probably 3D-print this.
- ***Minor parts:*** Minor parts like screws and glue may be required to assemble the parts together.

After I listed up essential pieces, I started sketching the pocket-sized fan with pen and paper, envisioning how I wanted it to look like. After making a series of small improvements, this is what I ultimately came up with.

I'm not sure if this is how the future external pocket-sized fan will look like, but it's a start for now. Since I don't know all the sizes for different parts, I'll need to be flexible and change the design as I work on it with Fusion360.
