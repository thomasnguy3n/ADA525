***Introduction***

During this week's assignment, we were all handed Arduinos and had a session on how to work with this kind of technology, as well as how to read and adjust their sensors and mechanisms by coding in C++.

With this assignment in mind, we aimed to use the Arduino to measure a value and provide an output of the result.

***Work History***

I started researching the *Adafruit Feather Bluefruit Sense - nRF52840*, an Arduino board, to the extent of understanding its properties and mechanics. This Arduino is an all-in-one chip that includes components such as a gyroscope and accelerometer, which can measure temperature and movement values. This Arduino is a perfect fit for my final project where I need to move or shake the fan to make it blow.

I used this code to make the Arduino detect movement and activate a light when movement is sensed.

{% raw %}```C++
//Code in C++

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Arduino_LSM6DS3.h>
#include <Adafruit_BMP280.h>

unsigned long prevMillis;
const int timeInterval = 500;
float x, y, z;
float xs = 0, ys = 0, zs = 0;
float prevX, prevY, prevZ;
int counter = 0;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialize the LSM6DS3 sensor.
  IMU.begin();

  // Configure pin A0 as an output for analog write.
  pinMode(A0, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read gyroscope data into the variables x, y, and z.
  IMU.readGyroscope(x, y, z);

  // Adjust the gyroscope data values.
  x = x - 4;
  y = y + 4.8;
  z = z + 2.75;

  // Measure the current time in milliseconds.
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  // Check if it's time to print the gyroscope data.
  if (currentMillis - prevMillis > timeInterval) {
    Serial.print("X: ");
    Serial.println(x);
    Serial.print("Y: ");
    Serial.println(y);
    Serial.print("Z: ");
    Serial.println(z);

    // Update prevMillis with the current time.
    prevMillis = currentMillis;
  }

  // Calculate the absolute differences between current and previous gyroscope data.
  int changeX = abs(x - prevX);
  int changeY = abs(y - prevY);
  int changeZ = abs(z - prevZ);

  // Check if any of the differences are greater than 100.
  if (changeX > 100 || changeY > 100 || changeZ > 100) {
    // Turn on an external component (e.g., a motor or LED) connected to pin A0.
    analogWrite(A0, 1023);
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second.
  } else {
    // Turn off the external component by setting the analog output to 0.
    analogWrite(A0, 0);
  }
}
```{% endraw %}

This code was done with the help of Sigve.

I encountered a major issue while running the code and attempting to upload it to the Arduino. It took me a considerable amount of time to identify the mistake, which was the reason my code wasn't fully executing when uploading it to the Arduino. Initially, I had designated the *Adafruit Feather Bluefruit Sense* as my main board when creating a new project for this assignment. This choice was entirely incorrect, and I only realized it when I switched to the *Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express*. After making this change, everything worked perfectly fine.

***Result***

After uploading the code file into the Arduino, I began reading and experimenting with the data I received from the device.

{% raw %}```Terminal
//Results from the terminal

X: -17.00
Y: 3.95
Z: -0.24
X: 3.51
Y: -0.69
Z: -0.85
X: -11.87
Y: 5.84
Z: 0.00
X: -26.28
Y: 4.43
Z: 1.35
X: -4.24
Y: 0.47
Z: 0.67
X: -54.11
Y: 11.76
Z: 0.98
X: 43.97
Y: -5.03
Z: 1.96
X: -19.01
Y: 0.71
Z: -0.18
X: -51.12
Y: 6.69
Z: 1.71
```{% endraw %}

Whenever I moved the Arduino that was connected to the device while it was running, new data appeared on the terminal. This data provided information on how the gyroscope sensor readings in the X, Y, and Z axes changed over time.

The light was briefly activated every time I moved the Arduino, which indicated the success of this task.
