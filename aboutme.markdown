I'm Thomas, currently pursuing my MSc in [Innovation for Technologists and Engineers](https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/responsible-innovation-and-sustainable-value-creation/) at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Bergen and have also undertaken studies abroad in the US, focusing on courses in Business and Leadership.

I'm an outdoorsy enthusiast who thrives on exploring new experiences. Over the past decade, I've embraced activities such as deathdiving, skydiving, climbing, trail running, and more. I firmly believe in pushing my boundaries, even when it means stepping into the realm of uncertainty.

This website serves as a platform for documenting and sharing 'blog-ish' content about my projects and constructions related to the [ADA525](https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/courses/2023/ADA525) course. I'm pretty new when it comes to 3D printing, laser cutting, electronics, circuit fabrication and that kind of stuff, but bear with me. This is going to be fun!
